# Helm Promote (Action)

Promote a Helm chart by pulling it from an OCI registry, updating versions, repackaging it, and publishing it to a target registry.

Features:
- Pull Helm charts from OCI registries
- Update chart version and appVersion
- Patch Docker image versions in values.yaml
- Support for custom patching script
- Publish promoted chart to target registry

The action supports authentication to a Helm registry. If `repo-user` and `repo-password` are provided, 
Authentication is optional for public registries.

A Custom patch script can be provided and will be executed in the chart directory context to be able to provide custom chart version / image tag patching logic.
The promoted chart is published to the target registry after packaging.
