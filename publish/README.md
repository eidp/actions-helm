# Helm Publish (Action)

Publish a Helm chart to a registry.

Make sure that the workflow using this action has access to the Chart registry by setting up appropriate secrets.
By default a chart is published to the GitHub container registry. For authentication, the default `GITHUB_TOKEN` is used which has sufficient permissions.

This action supports overriding the chart version and appVersion during packaging.
